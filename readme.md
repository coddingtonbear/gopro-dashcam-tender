*Note*: This is a WIP.

I use my GoPro as a dashcam, and although I rarely need to take any footage
off of my device, the GoPro will slowly accumulate videos over time.  This
device provides an easy way for me to clear the GoPro at the end of the 
day by just plugging my GoPro into it as its charger.
